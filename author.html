                    <h2>About the Author</h2>
                    <p>D.K. (Kim) Broadwell is a physician and specialist in aerospace medicine, now living in North Carolina. This is his debut novel. As a flight surgeon at NASA's Johnson Space Center during the space shuttle era, he has a unique perspective on astronauts, shuttle technical details and NASA internal politics. He is also a turbine rated pilot and operated an aircraft charter company for years before he wised up. The many hours of medical research he performed in NASA's zero-gravity KC-135 aircraft ("vomit comet") gives credence to life on the shuttle in orbit. He would have been an astronaut if his eyes weren't too weak. He's sticking by this story despite the facts.</p>
